          already built into dist.  Intended to run in an environment
          that has all build dependencies already installed (e.g. 
          developer's environment, inside a docker container).
    o  generate_dist.sh -- a script that will use docker to create a
          distribution ready for deployment.  Switch whether
          deployment products are bundled up (code-deploy context: no,
          local-deploy context: yes)??

## Version and Dependency Tracking

### Version string conventions

The version string given to a built product, in general, has the
following pattern:

   VERSION := TAG [':' BUILD]

where TAG is a string identifying either the explicit release or a
name that indicates the state of the repository or archive that the
product came from.  BUILD is an identifier indicating a particular
build applied on that repository to produce the product.

[TAG] can take different forms depending on the state of the
repository or archive:

   TAG := RELEASE | DEVID
   RELEASE := RELBASE [ '-rc' R ] [ '-' N '-' COMMIT ]
   DEVID   := BRANCH '-' COMMIT
   RELBASE := MAJ '.' MIN '.' BF
   MAJ, MIN, BF := 0..
   R, N := 1..

where RELEASE indicates an official release tagged by the project.

RELBASE by itself represents a production release of the product.  If
it is followed by "-rc", then the version identifies a release
candidate.  A TAG that ends with the "-N-COMMIT" pattern (where N is
an integer and COMMIT is an abbreviated git commit ID) indicates that
the source repository has N additional commits beyond its base tag
where the last one is identified by COMMIT (see "man git-describe").

RELBASE is a conventional 3-tiered version string, where MAJ is the
major release number, MIN is the minor release number, and BF is the
"bug fix" number.  All start with 0.  A difference in just the BF
number indicates two versions that are fully API compatible.  

The DEVID form indicates that the state of the repository bares no
relationship to an official release.  BRANCH is the name of the
repository branch that was checkout, and COMMIT identifies the last
commit on that branch.

BUILD modifiers indicates that the product is the result of a
particular build process.  Differences in products with different
BUILD modifiers may reflect differences in the build environment or
the versions of dependencies in place at the time of the build.

   BUILD := BUILDER '-' BN
   BN := N | COMMIT

BUILDER is a string indicating who or what built the product.  A value
of 'c' indicates that it was produced by the CICD system; otherwise,
it might be set to the username of the user executing the build.   BN
is either an integer (indicating a sequence) or an abbreviated git
commit string. 

#### Version examples

   1.1.12        -- the 12th production release of the 1.1.X series
                    (which started with 1.1.0)
   1.2.0rc3      -- the 3rd release candidate for version 1.2.0
   1.2.0rc3-4-a803fd1  -- the 3rd release candidate for version 1.2.0
                    after 4 commits have been added.  This might
                    appear prior to the tagging of 1.2.0rc4.
   integration-cf241a8 -- the integration branch when its last commit
                    was cf241a8.
   1.2.0rc3:c-1  -- the first build of the 3rd release candidate for
                    version 1.2.0 as built by the CICD system.
   1.2.0rc3:rlp3-4  -- the fourth build of the 3rd release candidate for
                    version 1.2.0 as built by user rlp3.
   

### Extracting the current version

 - setversion: script that
   1) creates VERSION containing the version string
   2) injects the version into the source code
     cmds: current branch:  git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
           current commit:  git rev-parse HEAD

### Creating a product level oar-dependencies.json

## Building and Testing

### Vocabulary 

A component is a stand-alone executable piece of an application
(e.g. the PDR Landing Page service).  A repository can provide one or
more components.  It may be represented by a single file (e.g. an
executable), but more often it is a collection of files that must be
installed into it execution platform (e.g. a docker container).  

A distribution is a packaging of a component into a single file so
that it can easily be archived, delivered and deployed to the
execution platform.  A distribution can actually contain include
multiple components or all of the components provided by a repository
if it is convenient to do so.

Distributions are created by build scripts and placed into the dist/.
Each distribution will have a name of the following form:

  DISTNAME-VERSION.PKGEXT

where DISTNAME is either a name for the single component it contains
or a general name reflecting all of the components.  VERSION is the
VERSION string written into the VERSION file during the build
process, and PKGEXT is file extension appropriate for the bundling
used (e.g. jar, zip, war, etc.)

### Build scripts

All projects are expected to have at least 2 scripts under scripts/
for building distributions:  makedist and makedist.docker.

makedist is for building distributions natively assuming that the
minimal dependencies have been installed already.  Such dependencies
typically includes the build and execution environment
(e.g. java/maven, python, or npm).  It may also include required Linux
packages installed into the OS (e.g. under /usr).  It would not
include dependencies that are pulled in automatically by the build
system (as with maven and npm).

makedist.docker is for building distributions when the minimal
dependencies have *not* been installed; instead, docker is used to
provide the build and testing environment (via Dockerfiles).  The
docker/ directory should also contain a script called makedist which
launches the necessary docker containters for building the
distributions.  The docker container entrypoint script may call
scripts/makedist or it may be more specialized.

There may be additional scripts of the form makedist.[CONTEXT] where
CONTEXT is a context where building is done (e.g. travis, cicd).
Their implementations may include testing.

A makedist should support optional arguments that are the names of the
components that should be built (at the exclusion of others).  If no
arguments are provided, all components should be built.

## Test Scripts

The script/ directory should also contain a script called testall.  It
should run assuming all dependencies installed natively.  It may
support command-line arguments that are names of individual components
to test.
